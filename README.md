# Faces of Fame
A Machine Learning Project to Identify Famous Celebrities.  We restrict classification to only 5 people.

1. Akshay Kumar
2. Benedict Cumberbatch
3. Christian Bale
4. Leonardo Dicaprio
5. Priyanka chopra




## The project involves the following key components:

### Data Collection: 
We collected a diverse dataset of images containing famous celebrities from various sources on the internet. The dataset is carefully curated and annotated with ground truth labels for each celebrity.

### Preprocessing:
 Before feeding the images into the machine learning models, we performed essential preprocessing steps, including resizing, and feature extraction. Use wavelet transform as a feature for traning our model.These steps help improve the performance of the models and ensure consistent input data.

### Machine Learning Algorithms:

SVM: Support Vector Machines are a powerful classification technique that finds an optimal hyperplane to separate different classes in a high-dimensional feature space.

Random Forest: Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that creates multiple decision trees and combines their outputs for better accuracy and robustness.

Logistic Regression: Logistic Regression is a simple yet effective algorithm for binary classification tasks like face detection.


### Model Evaluation:
 To assess the performance of each algorithm, we employed cross-validation tests and various evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
